# Auditing Calnode — a 10-minute self-serve security & quality check

Calnode's backend is ~30,800 lines of Go across 128 files (~1.1MB, excluding
tests). That's small enough to fit entirely in one LLM context window — which most
scheduling software (cal.com included) can't do. This page is our attempt to turn
"auditable" from a slogan into something you actually run, yourself, before you
trust Calnode with your calendar or your customers' meeting data.

**This is a due-diligence accelerator, not a certification.** It doesn't replace a
real penetration test or a formal security review if your org requires one — it's
meant to give you (or your security team) a credible first pass in minutes instead
of the weeks a typical vendor security review takes, and to short-circuit the part
of procurement that usually blocks everything else.

**Everything here runs on your machine, with your own tools and your own API key.**
Nothing routes through Calnode or any Calnode-hosted service. We don't see your
results, and you don't have to trust us to interpret them.

## 1. Architecture & trust boundaries, in one page

- **Single Go binary + embedded SQLite.** No Postgres, MySQL, or Redis. The binary
  `go:embed`s a compiled SvelteKit admin app; public booking pages are
  server-rendered Go templates.
- **Instance-per-tenant.** One deployment (one binary + one SQLite file) is one
  workspace. There's no shared multi-tenant database in the codebase to isolate —
  the deployment boundary *is* the tenant boundary.
- **Data flow, normal path:** booker hits a public `/book/{slug}` page (Go
  template, no auth) → the deterministic slot engine checks calendar free/busy
  (Google/Microsoft/CalDAV, native APIs, never stale `.ics`) → a booking is created
  transactionally (no double-booking races) → confirmation emails + optional
  webhooks fire.
- **Data flow, video + notetaker (opt-in):** a booking with a `livekit` location
  gets a hand-signed room token (no LiveKit SDK server-side) → recording, if the
  host starts it, goes to **your own** S3-compatible bucket → if the notetaker is
  enabled, the recording is transcribed via **Deepgram** (the one third-party
  service that ever sees meeting audio) and summarized via **your configured
  BYO-LLM**.
- **Secrets at rest** use envelope encryption (a per-secret key wrapped by a root
  key), not flat single-key encryption.
- **Every claim above** is mapped to exact source locations in
  [`audit/claims.yaml`](audit/claims.yaml) — don't take this page's word for it,
  check the manifest.

## 2. Layer 1 — deterministic scanners (no LLM, run this first)

Copy-paste this block against a fresh clone. All tools are standard, neutral,
widely-used security tooling — none of it is Calnode-specific.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Calnode/calnode && cd calnode

# Install the scanners (Go tools install cleanly with no CGO toolchain needed)
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
go install github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/v8@latest
go install github.com/anchore/syft/cmd/syft@latest
pip install semgrep   # or: brew install semgrep

# Known Go vulnerabilities reachable from your code (expect: no vulnerabilities found)
govulncheck ./...

# Go SAST — injection, crypto, unsafe patterns (expect: findings are all annotated
# inline with `#nosec` + a reason at that exact line — read a few to judge for
# yourself whether the reasoning holds up)
gosec ./...

# Secrets across the FULL git history, not just the current tree
gitleaks detect --source . --no-banner -v

# SBOM — see exactly what's in the Go dependency tree (should be lean; frontend
# npm packages are normal frontend-tooling volume, not part of this claim)
syft dir:. --exclude './frontend/node_modules/**' --exclude './.git/**' -o table

# Frontend (admin SvelteKit app) dependency vulnerabilities
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm audit && cd ..

# Generic security + secrets rulesets across the whole repo
semgrep scan --config p/security-audit --config p/secrets \
  --exclude frontend/node_modules --exclude frontend/build .
```

Our own latest run of this exact block: **govulncheck 0 · gosec 0 unresolved (all
findings annotated) · gitleaks 0 across 560 commits · semgrep 0**. Yours should
match — if it doesn't, that's either drift since our last run or something we need
to know about. (`govulncheck` and `gosec` are also re-run on every push to `main`
via `.github/workflows/audit.yml`, so an unannotated gosec finding or a new CVE
fails CI instead of silently accumulating — see `audit/claims.yaml`'s
`clean-security-scan` entry for the last time this actually caught something.)

We also publish an [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode) badge
and CI-generated SBOM — see the badge on [README.md](README.md) and the
`audit` workflow under **Actions** in this repo for the latest run.

## 3. Layer 2 — the adversarial LLM pass (the part a big codebase can't offer)

Deterministic scanners can't answer the questions a CISO actually asks: *where
does data really go, can tenant isolation be broken, is the auth model sound.*
Because Calnode's backend fits entirely in an LLM's context window, you can point
your **own** coding agent — Claude Code, Cursor, whatever you already use, with
**your own API key** — at the whole codebase and ask it directly.

**[→ audit/prompts/prompt-pack.md](audit/prompts/prompt-pack.md)** — six adversarial
prompts (trace all outbound egress, try to break tenant isolation, audit the auth
model, review crypto/secrets handling, hunt injection/SSRF/deserialization bugs,
attack the booking flow specifically). They're written to find problems, not to
confirm the code is fine — push your agent if it comes back vague.

Before reporting a finding as real, cross-check it against `audit/claims.yaml` —
several entries there (e.g. `fixed-roles-admin-full-access`,
`rate-limit-keys-on-tcp-source-address`) exist specifically because a prior run of
this exact adversarial pass flagged behavior that turned out to be intentional. An
LLM given no memory of past audits will regenerate the same false positive every
time unless it's told to check first; a real bug and a already-litigated design
choice can look identical from the code alone.

## 4. The claims manifest — falsifiable, including the unflattering parts

**[→ audit/claims.yaml](audit/claims.yaml)** maps every public claim we make (single
binary/no server DB, instance-per-tenant isolation, meeting-content egress scoped to
Deepgram only, envelope encryption at rest, consent-aware recording, consent-gated
analytics, BYO-LLM with no raw calendar access, the "small enough to audit" claim
itself) to exactly how to verify it — including the caveats and exceptions we'd
rather not have to admit, like recording consent being notice-and-choice rather than
a hard gate. Feed it to your agent alongside the prompt-pack and have it report
✅/⚠️ per claim against what it actually finds in the code.

## 5. Keeping this honest over time

The deterministic half of `claims.yaml` (no Postgres driver, no new third-party
egress, no secrets in history, no unresolved vulnerabilities, no unannotated SAST
findings) is wired into `.github/workflows/audit.yml` as CI assertions — so if a
future change silently breaks one of these claims (a new dependency drags in a
Postgres driver, a new integration starts sending recordings somewhere new, a new
gosec finding ships without a `#nosec` justification), the build fails instead of
the claim quietly going false. This manifest is a regression guard, not just a
one-time document.

This gate has already caught a real gap once: `gosec` was documented in this page's
scanner block (§2) as something you should expect to come back clean, but it had
never actually been added to `audit.yml` — only `govulncheck` and `gitleaks` were.
That let 44 unannotated findings accumulate silently before a routine audit re-run
caught it (see commit `c4c067c`). `gosec` is now a CI gate too, specifically so a
manual claim in prose can't drift from what CI actually checks again. `semgrep` is
the one scanner in §2 that is still manual-only (not yet a CI gate) — if you notice
it drift, that's a known gap, not a surprise.
