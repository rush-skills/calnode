-- ORGANIZER. With Resend's inbound email configured, that organizer is a per-booking reply
-- address (rsvp+<random token>@<rsvp domain>); Resend receives the reply, calls
-- POST /v1/email/inbound/resend, and Calnode records the answer on the booking.

-- The inbound address RSVPs are routed through (e.g. rsvp@reply.example.com). Empty = RSVP
-- tracking off: Calnode-sent invites are organized by the plain email sender, as before.

-- incoming RSVP finds its booking. Empty for bookings whose invite Calnode never sent.
