// Constraint violations are the one class of database error Calnode routinely acts

// a 400, a dangling reference is a 404. Deciding which is which was a substring match
// on SQLite's English message, which is invisible to every gate and, as the codes
// below show, cannot actually distinguish the two cases it is asked to.
//
// SQLite's extended result codes, as reported by (*sqlite.Error).Code().
//
// ⛔ SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY is a SEPARATE code from SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_UNIQUE
// even though both carry the message "UNIQUE constraint failed". A text match cannot
// tell them apart at all, and matching only 2067 would silently stop recognising
// primary-key collisions. Calnode has one that matters:
// idempotency_keys.idempotency_key is a bare PRIMARY KEY, so every idempotent replay
// arrives as 1555. Both belong to IsUniqueViolation.

// A driver error is a DEFINITE answer in both directions. A *sqlite.Error whose code
// does not match returns false and does not fall through to the text comparison —
// falling through would classify an error by whether its message happened to contain
// an English phrase, which is the fragility being removed. It would also reintroduce
// the primary-key trap in reverse: a 1555 error excluded by code would be readmitted
// by its "UNIQUE constraint failed" message.
//
// The text fallback is deliberate rather than vestigial. It covers an error that
// reaches here without the concrete driver type still attached — a driver release
// that changes its error type, a layer that reformats an error into a plain one
// instead of wrapping it. In that case the message is the only signal left, and
// answering from it beats answering "not a constraint violation" and returning a 500.
