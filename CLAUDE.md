# Calnode — agent notes

Go backend (SQLite, `go:embed`s the built SvelteKit SPA) + SvelteKit 5 admin UI
served under `/admin/`. Public booking pages are server-rendered Go templates
(`internal/handler/templates/*.html`), distinct from the Svelte admin app.

## Frontend toolchain

- Vite 8 (Rolldown) · SvelteKit 2 · Svelte 5 · Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`)
  · bits-ui / shadcn-svelte · Vitest 4 browser mode.
- The frontend is embedded at Go compile time (`frontend/embed.go` →
  `//go:embed all:build`). To see frontend changes in the running app: rebuild
  the frontend (`pnpm build` in `frontend/`) **and** rebuild/restart the Go
  binary — restarting Go alone won't pick up new assets.

## UI styling — required check

**Default to shadcn-svelte in the admin UI.** In the SvelteKit admin app (`frontend/`),
build from the existing shadcn-svelte components — `Button`/`buttonVariants`,
`ConfirmDialog` (**never** `window.confirm`/`alert`), `Dialog`, `Input`, `Switch`,
`Tooltip`, etc. Don't hand-roll buttons, modals, or browser-native dialogs. Destructive
actions use `ConfirmDialog` with `destructive`; row actions use a ghost icon button +
`Tooltip` (see `event-types`, `members`, `recordings`). **If shadcn genuinely doesn't fit,
flag it (and the reason) before deviating — don't silently hand-roll.** This does NOT apply
to the public booking templates (`internal/handler/templates/*.html`), `embed.js`, or the
LiveKit room — those are intentionally framework-free (Go templates / vanilla JS, own CSS).

shadcn-svelte components style state via Tailwind `data-*` variants. Bits-ui
states exposed as `data-state="…"` (checked/unchecked/open/closed) need an
`@custom-variant` remap in `frontend/src/app.css` or they render **silently
unstyled** (logic works, visuals don't). See `frontend/TESTING.md`.

**After changing `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/**`, `frontend/src/app.css`, or
the theme — run `pnpm test:visual`** (Vitest browser smoke). Unit tests do NOT
catch this class of bug; only the real-browser computed-style assertions do.

## Booking calendar — THREE surfaces, keep them aligned

The date/time-slot booking calendar exists in **three** places. A change to its
behaviour or markup must usually be made in all three, or they drift:

1. **Booking page** — `internal/handler/templates/book.html` (server-rendered Go template + vanilla JS)
2. **Manage page** — `internal/handler/templates/manage.html` (reschedule flow; same calendar/slots)
3. **Embed widget** — `internal/handler/embed.js` (Shadow-DOM Web Component on customer sites)

- **Styling is shared:** all three load `internal/handler/templates/booking.css`
  (served at `GET /booking.css`; the widget injects it into its shadow root). Change
  visuals **there**, once — don't re-style per surface.
- **Markup + JS are NOT shared** (Go template vs web component): the calendar render,
  slot picking, and the **mobile step-flow** (calendar → slots → form, with Back) are
  implemented separately in each. If you change calendar *behaviour*, update all three.
- Verify on **desktop and mobile** for each surface after touching the calendar.
- **Shared slot logic lives in `internal/handler/assets/booking-logic.js`** (tested with
  `node --test`): day grouping, time formatting, and the taken-slot merge. It is inlined
  into **book.html and manage.html only**, which are the two surfaces that load it.
- ⛔ **The embed widget does NOT load `booking-logic.js`, so `BookingLogic` is undefined
  inside it.** `EmbedJS` serves `embed.js` as its own standalone file, unmodified — it is a
  Shadow-DOM web component on a third-party page, with no build step and nothing to
  prepend the module for it. It therefore carries its own copies of the few helpers it
  needs (`dowLabels`, `dayKey`, `timeLabel`, `shortDay`, `ymd`), each commented as
  mirroring the shared one. Calling `BookingLogic.anything` from `embed.js` throws a
  `ReferenceError` on the customer's site, where no test here would see it. So: put logic
  the pages share in `booking-logic.js`, and when the widget needs it too, mirror it there
  deliberately and keep the two in step.
- **Taken/booked slots** (`show_taken_slots`, off by default) are computed by
  `slots.GenerateWithTaken` as the *difference* between a normal pass and one ignoring
  busy, which is what keeps out-of-hours and min-notice starts from being mislabelled as
  booked. Never feed them to MCP or the assistant - `computeSlots(..., includeTaken)`
  makes each caller say. See ARCHITECTURE §8.

## Conversational booking assistant (optional LLM layer)

The "Book by chat" assistant lives on **two** of those surfaces — `book.html` (floating
drawer + inline link) and `embed.js` (inline link only; no floating button, to avoid
colliding with host-site widgets). **Not** on the manage page (reschedule context — a
reschedule chat is deliberately deferred). Server side is one endpoint,
`POST /v1/event-types/{slug}/assistant` (`booking_assistant.go`): an LLM tool-loop that
drives `find_available_slots`/`book` over the **shared deterministic cores** (`computeSlots`,
`createBookingForSlug`) — never re-implement booking logic in the assistant. Invariants:
the LLM does NL→constraints only (never time math), sees only computed availability (never
raw calendar data), and `<think>` reasoning is stripped. Shared `.asst-*` styles are in
`booking.css`; the base prompt (`assistantBaseRules`) is code-owned, admins only append
"Additional instructions". Off by default — `getLLM()` nil → the picker is the fallback.

## Built-in video meetings (LiveKit)

Self-hostable video as a booking location type (`location_type = "livekit"`). **No LiveKit SDK
server-side** — all tokens are hand-signed. The browser room app is **vanilla JS + a vendored
client SDK**, not Svelte.

- **Where it lives:** room UI = `internal/handler/templates/livekit-room.html` +
  `assets/livekit-room.js` (+ vendored `assets/livekit-client.umd.min.js`). Server =
  `internal/livekit/` (`livekit.go` token signing, `admin.go` Twirp/egress) and
  `internal/handler/livekit_room.go` + `livekit_recording.go`. Settings UI =
  `frontend/src/routes/settings/video/`.
- **Three token kinds (don't conflate):** (1) **room token** — opaque HMAC blob in the join URL
  (`{r,e,role}`), carries no LiveKit grant; (2) **access token** — the real LiveKit HS256 JWT the
  SDK joins with (`AccessToken`/`VerifyAccessToken`); (3) **admin token** — short-lived JWT for
  Twirp server APIs.
- **Host authority — `authorizeHost`, NOT just the room token.** A host action is allowed if the
  caller is the **durable host** (`hostRoomOrOwner`: holds a host room token OR is the signed-in
  booking owner) **OR** the **current reassigned host** — proven by verifying their *access token*
  and confirming that identity has `metadata="host"` right now (`ListParticipants`). Clients send
  **both** `t` (room token) and `at` (access token) on every host call. **Reclaim host is
  durable-host-only.** Reassigning only flips metadata, so without the access-token path a temp
  host has the badge but no real power — that gap is exactly what `authorizeHost` closes.
- **Single host:** any host join demotes prior hosts (`demoteOtherHosts` → metadata `"attendee"`);
  the client downgrades only on explicit `"attendee"`, never on a transient/empty metadata event.
- **Recording (Egress):** room-composite → the **Litestream backups bucket** (`LITESTREAM_*` env),
  `recordings/` prefix. **Finalize on stop/end (`finalizeActiveRecording`), do NOT depend on the
  webhook** — `object_key` is set at start so downloads work without it; a startup sweep closes
  orphaned `active` rows. Idempotent guard keys on an `active` row per room.
- **Webhook = single sink** `POST /v1/livekit/webhook` (legacy alias `/v1/livekit/egress-webhook`,
  keep it). LiveKit allows one URL per project, so it receives **all** events; we verify the
  signature and act only on `egress_started/ended/failed` + `room_finished` (everything else is
  200-ACKed and dropped). The **egress lifecycle is the source of truth** for the recording flag.
- **Recording banner** is driven by room **metadata** (`{recording, allowShare}`) + the
  `RoomMetadataChanged` realtime event — it's an in-room overlay, so `showOnly` hides it off the
  room view. **Always `mergeRoomMeta` (read-merge-write), never overwrite** — recording and
  screen-share flags would clobber each other.
- **Attendee screen-share defaults OFF**; host opts in (gear menu). Enforced server-side via
  `canPublishSources` at token mint + live `UpdateParticipant`, not just hidden in the UI.
- Room HTML is served `no-store` and injects `?v=<content-hash>` onto the room JS/SDK assets —
  bump-free cache-busting. After changing the room JS/HTML you still need a frontend-independent
  Go rebuild (these assets are `go:embed`-ed in the handler package, not the SPA).
- **Watch the room JS complexity.** `livekit-room.js` has grown large + stateful (host model,
  single-host, consent, chat, layout, recording) with state in scattered module flags + manual
  DOM updates — several bugs traced to that (stale state, the metadata up/down-grade logic). It's
  fine now, but if it keeps growing the move is NOT "shadcn-ify it" (it's deliberately
  framework-free) — it's tidy-in-place: one state object + a single derive/render, extract the
  pure logic (host/consent state machines) into testable functions. A dedicated tiny Svelte build
  is the last resort, not the first.

## Languages (i18n) - data-driven, adding one touches no code

Public surfaces (book.html, manage.html, embed.js, the four emails, calendar invite
title/description) are translated. **NOT translated: the admin SPA, the LiveKit room**
(`livekit-room.html`/`.js`, ~45 hardcoded strings - it has its own asset pipeline and shares
no string plumbing with the Go templates), and admin-authored content (event names,
descriptions, questions, custom email copy). Locale is resolved per request from
`Accept-Language` + a `?lang=` override + the operator's fallback setting
(`internal/handler/i18n.go`), and the booker's locale is stored on the booking so later
reminders match. Ships `en es fr fr-CA de it pt nl sv`. Full detail: ARCHITECTURE §23.

**Adding a locale = adding `internal/i18n/locales/<code>.json`.** Nothing else. `init()`
globs the directory; the switcher, the fallback dropdown and the public API payload all read
`SupportedLocales()`. Name the file **BCP-47 canonical** (`pt-BR.json`, never `pt-br.json`).

- Go has no locale date data, so `date_format`, `clock_format`, `dow_short_*` and
  `month_short_*` are **keys in the JSON** (`internal/i18n/datetime.go`), not stdlib calls.
- Three guards police a new file: same-keys, printf-verb parity (uses `fmt` as the oracle),
  and `TestDateTablesMatchCLDR`, which cross-checks the date tables against `Intl` via node.
  Run `go test ./internal/i18n/`.
- Tests use `ja`/`ko` to mean "a language we don't ship". If you add either,
  `assertUnsupported`/`requireUnsupported` fail loudly and tell you what to change.
- **Every non-English locale is an LLM draft with no native review.** Structure is verified;
  wording is not. Say so before anyone markets a language.

### Where a translated sentence gets assembled

**Default: server-side.** Go composes the finished sentence and the page renders it as
given. `durationLabel`, `hostsLabel`, `locationLabel`, `assistantGreeting` and
`noticeLabel` (`book.go`) are the pattern - they return text, not parts. Keeping it there
is what stops plural rules, duration wording and date formats from being reinvented in
three separate front ends, only one of which has tests.

**One exception, and it is the only one:** a booking-surface string whose argument is
chosen by the visitor *after the page loads* may be substituted client-side, via
`BookingLogic.fmt` (book/manage) or its deliberate mirror in `embed.js`. Today that is
exactly the selected date, in `no_available_times`, `no_available_times_host` and
`min_notice_hint`. The alternative is a server round-trip on every calendar click, or
shipping a month of pre-rendered sentences to render one.

The line that still holds inside the exception: **anything locale-dependent is computed
in Go and passed in as a finished fragment.** `MinNoticeLabel` is the model - the server
sends "4 hours" already pluralised and translated, and the page only drops it into a
slot. `fmt` handles `%s` and the indexed `%[n]s` (so a translation can reorder its
arguments) and nothing else; it is not a printf and must not become one.

**If you are building a plural form, a duration or a date format in JavaScript, you have
crossed the line** - move it into `book.go` and send the result.

## Email - two transports, and the SMTP trap

`internal/mailer` has **two** real transports behind one `Mailer` interface: `smtp.go` and
`resend.go` (HTTPS to `api.resend.com`). **`handler.BuildMailer` is the ONLY place the
choice is made** - boot (`server.go`) and settings-save both call it, so they cannot drift.
The rule: a Resend API key selects HTTPS, else an SMTP host selects SMTP, else `Noop`.

- **Do not turn this into probe-and-fallback.** It was considered and rejected: a probe
  tests reachability at boot rather than at send time, an open TCP port is not a working
  delivery path, and silent switching masks a broken SMTP config while making "which path
  sent this?" unanswerable. Credentials state intent.
- **Why the HTTPS path exists at all:** several platforms (Railway below Pro) block
  outbound SMTP by *dropping* packets. It presents as a hang, then as a credentials
  problem, on every SMTP port, for every provider. Nothing at the SMTP layer fixes it.
- **Keep the dial bounded.** `defaultSMTPTimeout` must be on the dialers (`newDialers`),
  not only on `conn.SetDeadline`, which runs after the dial. Unbounded, a packet-dropping
  host hangs ~2 min and stalls the job queue, which shares the single SQLite connection.
- **`.ics` invites carry `method=REQUEST` in their Content-Type** - that parameter is what
  makes clients show RSVP instead of a file. The Resend path sets `content_type`
  explicitly; if invites ever arrive as plain attachments, look there first
  (`TestICSAttachmentKeepsItsMethodParameter`).
- Adding a secret to email settings: use `storeEmailSecret`, and make the JSON field a
  **pointer** so "omitted" (keep) stays distinguishable from `""` (clear).

## Event types: slot interval is not the duration

`slot_interval_minutes` = how often a booking may **start**. `duration_minutes` = how long it
**runs**. Deliberately independent (a 45-min meeting offered on the hour is valid). New event
types default the interval to the duration; existing ones keep what is stored, so a change of
default is never retroactive. `slots.Generate` refuses a non-positive interval, so create and
update both validate it - an unvalidated `0` yields an event type with no bookable times and
no explanation. Reported as issue #13, where the setting being absent from the admin UI looked
exactly like duration being ignored.

Keep the editor's floor aligned with the API's (`>= 1`). A stricter client-side minimum makes
an event type configured below it via the API unsaveable from the editor, even when the person
is editing an unrelated field.

**The general rule, learned twice:** the admin editor submits the WHOLE form on every save,
so validating a field merely because the request mentions it validates fields the operator
never touched. Any event type holding a stored value the current rules reject then becomes
unsaveable entirely, with an error pointing at something unrelated. Validate on **change**
(effective value vs stored), not on **mention**. Rows reach those states legitimately: a
provider disconnected after the fact, a duplicate that inherited one (#22), a seeder writing
straight to the table, or a create path that defaulted the field before a rule tightened.

The other half of the same rule: **anything written without validation must be valid by
construction.** `CreateEventType` skips `validateLocation` when it defaults the location,
because there is no request field to blame an error on - so every branch of
`smartDefaultLocation` has to return a type the owner can actually host at. It used to end
at an unconditional `"zoom"`.

## Conventions

- `pnpm` (not npm). Use `pnpm exec <tool>` for local binaries.
- Verify changes against the real app, not just builds — this codebase has been
  bitten by CSS that compiles fine but renders wrong.

## Distribution packaging (packaging/)

- One channel per directory: `packaging/ns8/` is the NethServer 8 module
  (imageroot actions, systemd unit, Vue settings UI, robot tests). Future
  channels (Umbrel, Coolify, TrueNAS, etc.) get siblings, never a mega-PR.
- The NS8 module is a thin wrapper around the published app image, built by
  `.github/workflows/ns8-module.yml` with the same tag scheme as
  `docker-publish.yml`. Release tags pin module and app to the same version.
- The committed systemd unit keeps a `__CALNODE_APP_IMAGE__` placeholder;
  `packaging/ns8/build-images.sh` stamps the real app ref at build time.
