# Changelog

All notable changes to Calnode are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

**Pre-1.0 note:** while Calnode is in the `0.x` series, a **minor** bump (e.g.
`0.1` → `0.2`) may include breaking changes to the API, schema, or config. Pin an
exact tag (`ghcr.io/calnode/calnode:0.1.0`) if you need stability between upgrades.
`1.0.0` will mark the point at which the API and schema are declared stable.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **The timezone picker now lists every IANA zone**, not a hand-picked fifteen (India was
  missing, among most of the world). It reads the browser's own table and falls back to
  the short list only on very old browsers; a stored zone outside the list is kept.
- **Availability now says which timezone it is in.** Weekly hours are interpreted in the
  host's profile timezone, but the page never said so, and a mismatch with the browser
  silently shifted every slot. The page now names the zone, flags a browser mismatch, and
  links to Profile.
- **Members could not staff an event type.** Opening the Hosts tab as a regular member
  failed with "admin access required": the member and team lists it fills its pickers from
  were admin-only reads. Any signed-in member can now read the member directory and the
  team list (active members only; the archived view and every team or member mutation
  stay admin-only).

### Changed
- **The "Powered by Calnode" line is gone from the public booking surfaces** (booking page,
  manage page, embed widget, person and team pages). The legal footer (privacy, terms,
  language) stays.
- **Any admin can now make a member an admin.** Granting admin used to be owner-only, which
  made one person the bottleneck for a growing team. Taking admin away from another admin
  stays owner-only, the same rule that already governs resetting an admin's password or
  archiving them, so admins cannot demote each other.

### Added
- **Org-wide event types.** Every event type is now visible to the whole workspace by
  default (`visibility = org`; existing rows are converted), so any member can open and
  share every booking link. The creator and any admin can edit an org event type; everyone
  else sees it read-only. A "Only me" visibility keeps an event type private to its owner.
  Slugs are normalised on create as well as update (spaces and symbols become hyphens, blank
  slugs derive from the name) and a startup sweep repairs stored slugs that were never
  normalised, so a booking link can no longer be broken by its own slug.
- **Default participants.** Settings → Default participants lists addresses (a notetaker
  bot, a shared mailbox) that are invited on the host's calendar event of every meeting
  booked on the workspace. They receive the provider's calendar invite only: Calnode sends
  them no email and bookers never see them.
- **"Show host names on booking pages"** (Settings → Branding, on by default). Turned off,
  the booking page, manage page, embed widget and team page show only the event name and
  never a host's name or avatar; names are withheld server-side so no surface can leak them.
- **Allowed sign-in domains.** Settings → Google OAuth lists email domains whose verified
  Google or Microsoft sign-ins create a member account on first login, so a team no longer
  invites every colleague by hand. Off by default (invite-only, as before). A member created
  this way gets their browser's timezone rather than UTC.
- **"Some always attend" staffing mode.** An event type can name hosts who are on every
  booking (required or optional) alongside a rotation that supplies one more, for finer
  control than "rotate" or "everyone attends".
- **Calendar invite message per event type**, edited as rich text, placed on the attendee's
  calendar invite and the .ics above the booking-id line. Email custom notes are rich text
  too, and the booker's question answers are put on the host's calendar event.
- **Any attending host can reschedule or cancel a booking**, not just the primary.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **NethServer 8 module (`packaging/ns8`).** Calnode ships as a one-click NS8
  app: host-based Traefik route with cluster TLS, SQLite on a persistent
  volume, generated encryption key preserved across reconfigures, and release
  tags that pin module and app to the same version. Preview-grade: installed
  and configured paths are covered by robot tests but no live node has run
  one end to end yet — see `packaging/ns8/README.md`.

### Fixed
- **Public booking lookup is now rate-limited.** `GET /v1/bookings/{id}` needs no
  auth by design (it carries no PII), but it was the one public route outside
  any rate limiter — an enumeration free-for-all. It shares the manage-token
  bucket now.
- **CalDAV connect failures no longer distinguish error classes.** Refused vs
  timeout vs TLS vs auth failures were surfaced verbatim to the member form, a
  usable LAN-scan oracle. The form returns one generic message and logs the
  detail server-side; timing side-channels are accepted as residual.
- **CalDAV no longer sends Basic credentials on cross-origin redirects.** A
  redirect to another origin now drops the Authorization header instead of
  forwarding the app password to a server the user never configured.
- **A short `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` no longer panics at boot.** The startup log
  sliced the first 20 characters unconditionally; unset-or-short values
  crashed the process instead of logging the usual "not configured" warning.
- **Video room explains host takeover instead of silently dropping controls.**
  Sharing the host link lets anyone take over as host, and the demoted side
  just lost its controls with no explanation. Host-link holders are now warned
  pre-join not to share it, and a demotion names who took over with a reclaim
  hint for owners.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-27

### Security
- **Moving or cancelling a CalDAV booking no longer sends another account's app password
  to the server holding the event.** A host can connect several CalDAV accounts, and
  rescheduling or cancelling authenticated as whichever account was the destination at
  the time, not the one the event was written to. After a host moved their destination
  from an account on one server to an account on another, every reschedule or cancel of
  an older booking sent the new account's username and app password to the old account's
  server. A server that refused them left the calendar unchanged and the reconciler
  retried, sending them again every sweep for a cancelled booking and until the end time
  for a moved one. A server that answered 404 instead was taken at its word: the event
  counted as already gone and stayed where it was.

  Update and cancel now authenticate as the account that holds the event, found from what
  the booking stored: the calendar recorded at creation, or failing that the connected
  calendar whose URL contains the event's URL (same scheme, host and port). If no single
  account can be established, nothing is sent, and the reconciler logs one warning and stops
  retrying that event rather than refusing it again every sweep; the event stays where it
  is. Hosts who moved a
  CalDAV destination between accounts on different servers should consider rotating the
  app password of the account they moved to.
- **A booker's email address is validated where it enters, and is never written into an
  email header unparsed.** The `To:` header was the one header field assembled from
  caller-supplied input with no encoder in front of it: `buildRaw` parsed each recipient
  with `net/mail` and, when that failed, appended the raw string anyway, so a CR/LF inside
  an address would have ended the `To:` line and started a header of the sender's
  choosing. Subject and the `From` display name already go through `mime.QEncoding`
  (which renders CR/LF as `=0D`/`=0A`) and attachment filenames through `%q`.

  Not exploitable as shipped: `Send` issues `c.Rcpt(to)` before `DATA`, and `net/smtp`
  runs `validateLine` inside `Rcpt`, refusing any CR or LF - so a CRLF-bearing address
  aborted the exchange at `RCPT TO` and never reached the body. That protection is
  incidental, lives one call away in the standard library, and covers only this
  transport. `buildRaw` now refuses an unparsed address (and an empty recipient list)
  outright, returning `mailer.ErrInvalidRecipient` before anything is dialed; the
  rejected value is kept out of the error, which is logged.

  The public booking paths validate at intake rather than relying on the mailer: the REST
  handler (`POST /v1/bookings`) answers 400 "email must be a valid email address", and
  the shared core behind the conversational assistant's `book` tool and the MCP
  `create_booking` tool checks the address before it persists anything. Both store the
  parsed bare address, so a pasted `Bob <bob@example.com>` is recorded as
  `bob@example.com` - a small deliberate behaviour change, matching what the hourly
  throttle, the per-invitee cap and the `To:` header already assume they hold.
### Added
- **Sign out everywhere.** `POST /v1/auth/sessions/revoke-all` ends every session you
  have except the one you asked from, so losing a laptop no longer means waiting out a
  30-day cookie. Pass `{"user_id": "..."}` and an admin can do the same for someone
  else: an admin may revoke a member, only the owner may revoke another admin, and the
  owner's own sessions can only be ended by the owner.

  It also revokes that person's MCP OAuth tokens, which is the part that makes it an
  offboarding tool rather than a convenience. A connected agent authenticates with a
  bearer token and not the session cookie, so ending the sessions alone would have left
  it holding exactly the access that was just withdrawn.
- **Canadian French (`fr-CA`) on the booker-facing surfaces.** A visitor whose browser asks
  for `fr-CA` now gets Canadian French rather than the France copy; `fr` and `fr-FR` are
  unaffected. It is the first regional locale, and a separate file rather than a fallback
  because the differences are real: `courriel` rather than `e-mail`, `reporter`/`report`
  rather than `reprogrammer`, `renseignements personnels` (the Quebec statutory term) rather
  than `données personnelles`, no space before `!` `?` `;` where France puts one, and CLDR
  itself spells July `juill.` here against `juil.` in France.

  ⚠️ **The wording is an unreviewed draft**, like every non-English locale in this
  repository: the structure is verified by the same three guards (same keys, printf-verb
  parity, date tables cross-checked against CLDR), but no native Canadian French speaker has
  read the copy. Corrections are welcome and easy to merge — see CONTRIBUTING.

- **`FRAME_ANCESTORS`: embed the admin UI in your own console.** Space-separated origins
  (`https://console.example.com 'self'`); when set, `/admin/` sends
  `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors <list>`. The public booking pages are
  untouched and still deny framing outright — this is about the console, not the pages
  that take card details.

  Two deliberate refusals. An entry that is not `https://host[:port]` or `'self'` stops
  the app booting rather than being ignored, because a browser drops a source list it
  cannot parse, which would leave the admin UI *more* embeddable than the setting being
  unset. And no `X-Frame-Options` is sent beside it: that header has no allow-list form,
  so the only value it could carry is `SAMEORIGIN`, which browsers honour instead of the
  CSP and would break the embedding this exists for.

- **Per-person and team booking pages.** A handle set in profile settings buys
  `/u/{handle}`: every public, active event type the person owns or hosts, with
  duration, location and price per type. Teams get `/team/{slug}` with their types
  plus a member roster linking to each member's page. Archived users 404, and handles
  are slugified, unique, and cleared by blanking the field. Answers
  [#94](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/94).
- **Custom-hours date overrides take several blocks.** A date override used to hold a
  single window while weekly rules take as many as you like, so a split day (open
  morning and afternoon around a mid-day appointment) had no honest expression. Dates
  now hold any number of custom blocks; a blocking override replaces the customs on
  its date, an exact duplicate still 409s, and the list flags blocks that overlap
  and merge. Answers
  [#95](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/95).
- **SMTP through a separate relay address.** Some providers require the SMTP session
  to open against a relay host distinct from the mail domain: the relay address is
  now configured explicitly instead of derived. Thanks
  [@marijnbent](https://github.com/marijnbent) ([#65](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/pull/65)).

### Fixed
- **SMTP email works with servers that offer AUTH LOGIN but not AUTH PLAIN.**
  Calnode previously used PLAIN for every authenticated SMTP connection, which
  failed against servers such as Microsoft 365 that advertise `LOGIN XOAUTH2`
  after STARTTLS. It now prefers PLAIN when offered and uses LOGIN otherwise.
  LOGIN requires TLS, and servers offering neither supported method return a
  clear error.
- **Rescheduling on the manage page works again.** Its slot list called an `esc()`
  helper that only ever existed on the booking page, so any day with availability
  threw before rendering and could not be rescheduled. The helper is now defined
  on both surfaces.
- **Removing a member no longer 500s on booking history, and no longer leaves
  their MCP tokens valid.** `booking_hosts.user_id` had no `ON DELETE` action;
  both it and the token tables now cascade. The upcoming-booking guard covers
  group seats too, and primary-host history (past or present) blocks with a 409
  naming reassignment instead of failing in SQL.
- **Cancelling a paid booking cannot double-refund.** The refund row is claimed
  with a conditional update before Stripe is called, the call carries an
  idempotency key, and a Stripe failure reverts the claim so a later cancel
  retries instead of silently keeping the money.
- **A lost confirmation email is retried once and then flagged, not just logged.**
  Confirmation sends get one retry; a final failure sets `confirm_failed` on the
  booking, surfaced on the booking JSON for follow-up.
- **The slots response says when its busy data is incomplete.** A provider outage
  used to read as free time while booking stayed fail-closed, offering slots that
  could not be sold. Slots now carry `degraded: true`, and all three booking
  surfaces show a warning.
- **Rescheduling or cancelling after a destination change acts on the provider that
  holds the event.** The booking stored which calendar its event was written to but
  not which provider wrote it, so a destination move handed old event ids to a
  provider that never issued them: silent orphans one way, endless reconciler
  retries the other. Each host event now stamps its provider at creation; updates
  and cancels prefer the stamp, then id recognition (CalDAV URLs), then the current
  destination for pre-stamp rows. Answers
  [#58](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/58).
- **The calendar picker no longer drops calendars past the first page.** Microsoft
  requested `$top=100` calendars once and Google `maxResults=250` once, so anything
  beyond silently vanished: unreachable for conflict checks and unchoosable as the
  destination. Both listings now follow `@odata.nextLink` / `nextPageToken` to the
  end. Answers [#59](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/59).
- **The Zoom setup text no longer promises that an unpublished app works for "your own
  team".** Zoom only lets users inside the Zoom account that owns an unpublished app
  authorize it, so a member with their own Zoom account was refused on a Zoom error page
  that Calnode never sees. Settings → Zoom now says so, and `DEPLOY.md` gains a Zoom
  section with Zoom's three ways around it (same account, beta sharing, publishing) and
  the link-only fallback that needs no Zoom app. Answers
  [#35](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/35).

- **A CalDAV event is moved or deleted even after the destination moves to Google or
  Microsoft.** The event was handed to the new destination's provider, which could not
  find an id it never issued, so the event stayed on the CalDAV calendar at its old time,
  or after its booking was cancelled. A CalDAV event id is the event's URL, which is now
  enough to route it back to the CalDAV provider whatever the destination is.
- **Microsoft calendars can be chosen as the one bookings are written into.** Since 0.5.0
  the calendar picker marked every Microsoft calendar "(read-only)" and disabled its Book
  option. The calendar list read Graph's `canEdit` but left it out of `$select`, so Graph
  never returned it and every calendar decoded as not writable. It is now requested, and a
  test fails if that request omits any property the response decodes.
- **Cancellations name who cancelled.** The bookings page sent a hardcoded "cancelled by
  admin" reason that the server stored verbatim, so a member cancelling their own booking
  emailed as an admin cancel. The server now composes "Cancelled by {name}" from the
  authenticated caller and ignores the client string; booker manage-link and system
  cancels keep their own reasons. Answers
  [#90](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/90).
- **The dashboard lists every booking link instead of crowning one.** With several event
  types it showed a single "Your booking link" pointing at whichever came first. One
  event type keeps the single-link box; several render a per-type list with names, copy
  buttons, and the profile page link once a handle is set. Answers
  [#93](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/93).
- **A rescheduled LiveKit meeting gets fresh join links.** Room names are stable but the
  signed URLs expire past the meeting end, so rescheduling past the original date left
  every stored link dead. Reschedule now re-mints both links on the same room with an
  expiry past the new end before the emails go out. Answers
  [#98](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/98).
- **A second Microsoft account no longer replaces the first.** Entra tenants omit the
  `preferred_username`/`email` claims by default, so the account identifier came back
  empty and saving the new connection deleted the old one. Calnode now requests the
  `profile` and `email` scopes, falls back to the stable `tid:oid` pair, and refuses the
  connection with an actionable error rather than storing an empty dedup key. Answers
  [#99](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/99).
- **External calendars are rechecked before a booking is created.** Availability was
  computed, then the booking was written without re-reading the providers, so an event
  landing in the gap double-booked. Creation now rechecks and fails closed with
  provider failures distinguished. Thanks
  [@marijnbent](https://github.com/marijnbent) ([#66](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/pull/66)).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **Duplicate an event type.** `POST /v1/event-types/{slug}/duplicate`, and a Duplicate
  action on each row of the event-types list. Closes
  [#17](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/17).

  The copy carries everything that hangs off the original - intake questions, host
  assignments, event-type-specific availability rules, the reminder schedule, and the
  custom email subjects and notes - as a single transaction, so a half-built copy can
  never be left behind. It is created inactive, under a generated `<slug>-copy` (then
  `-copy-2`, `-copy-3`, …) slug, and keeps `price_cents`/`currency` verbatim: zeroing a
  copied price is how a paid meeting quietly starts selling for nothing. Bookings are not
  copied.
- **Empty days and minimum-notice gaps now explain themselves** on all three booking
  surfaces (booking page, manage/reschedule page, embed widget). Closes
  [#20](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/20).

  A day with nothing on it names the day, and the host when the event type has exactly
  one, instead of the bare "No available times." that never said whether another day would
  help. And when `min_notice_minutes` is what removed the nearest starts, the surfaces say
  so rather than leaving the visitor to guess - the most common "why can't I see those
  times".

  The engine decides that, not the front ends: `GET /slots` gains
  `min_notice: {minutes, dates}` listing the booker-local days the policy actually cost
  something. A start that is simply in the past, one a booking took away, and one no host
  pool could satisfy are all excluded, so the explanation never appears attached to the
  wrong cause. Three new/changed keys in all eight locales.

### Fixed
- **Constraint violations are recognised by SQLite's error code rather than by its
  English message.** Thirteen call sites asked `strings.Contains(err.Error(), "UNIQUE
  constraint failed")`, and SQLite reports a PRIMARY KEY collision
  (`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY`, 1555) with that exact message while giving it a
  different code from an ordinary unique violation (`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_UNIQUE`, 2067).
  The text could not tell the two apart, so nothing that needed to distinguish them
  could.

  `db.IsUniqueViolation`, `db.IsCheckViolation` and `db.IsForeignKeyViolation` answer
  from the driver's code, falling back to the message only for an error that arrives
  without its driver type still attached. A driver error whose code does not match is a
  definite no rather than a fall-through, so an error cannot be classified by whether
  its text happened to contain an English phrase.

  Each class is provoked against the real schema in a test rather than constructed by
  hand, including the primary-key case, which is the one a code match written from the
  message alone would get wrong.

- **`TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`: per-IP rate limits that work behind a CDN.** Rate limits key
  on the TCP peer, which is right for a directly-reachable instance and useless behind a
  fronting CDN, where every visitor arrives from the same handful of addresses and shares
  one bucket. List the networks you control, a fronting CDN's own ranges included, and
  the client IP is taken from `X-Forwarded-For` walked right to left past those hops.

  Nothing changes if you do not set it: a header from a peer you have not listed is still
  not read at all, because it is a value the client chose. Within the header the *leftmost*
  entry is likewise client-chosen, so the walk stops at the rightmost address one of your
  proxies actually observed, and a malformed hop ends the walk on the peer rather than
  being stepped over. Repeated `X-Forwarded-For` field lines are joined in order rather
  than only the first being read, so a client's own line in front of a proxy that adds a
  second one cannot hide the hop that matters. Single-value vendor headers (`CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Real-IP`,
  `True-Client-IP`) are never read, from any peer: the setting names networks rather than
  CDNs, and a plain reverse proxy in the list forwards whatever the client sent.

  Follow-ups on the above: the empty-day message keeps its call to action as well as
  naming the day ("No available times on Monday, 14 September. Try another date."), in
  all eight locales; the minimum-notice line gets its own `.notice-hint` style, a shade
  darker than the placeholder text it used to be indistinguishable from; and the notice
  gap is now computed only for callers that asked for it, so the MCP tool and the booking
  assistant stop paying for a presentation aid they never render.

- **An event type's booking link can be renamed until its first booking.** `PATCH
  /v1/event-types/{slug}` now accepts `slug`, and the editor exposes it as "Booking link".
  Refused with 409 once bookings exist, because by then the link is in circulation and
  somebody's manage link resolves through it. Mainly this is what makes a duplicate
  usable: it arrives as `<slug>-copy` and there was previously no way to give it a real
  name short of deleting and recreating it.

- **An event type can no longer be created in a state the editor refuses to save.** Three
  related fixes: creating one without a location defaulted to Zoom without checking whether
  the owner had connected Zoom (it now falls back to in-person, which needs nothing);
  `PATCH` validated the location whenever the request mentioned it, which the editor does on
  every save, so a stored value the current rules reject locked the operator out of every
  other field (it now validates only when the location actually changes); and the demo
  seeder wrote `link` with no URL, so a demo visitor's first edit failed on a field they had
  never touched.

### Removed
- `BookingLogic.bookableDayKeys` and `book.html`'s `bookableDates`, which were written in
  0.8.0 and never read by anything.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Booked times can be shown struck through instead of hidden.** Off by default, and
  enabled per event type under Visibility. Requested in
  [#14](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/discussions/14), tracked as
  [#19](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/19).

  For a public-hours use case - an intro call, a clinic, a tutor - a visibly busy
  calendar communicates demand, and an empty-looking list reads as "nothing here". It
  stays off by default because the slots endpoint is public and unauthenticated, so
  turning it on makes a host's booked hours legible to anyone with the link. That is a
  fair trade when the hours are already public and a privacy regression when they are
  not, so it is never inherited by upgrading.

  Only starts a booking or calendar conflict removed are shown. Times outside the host's
  working hours are never rendered, and times withheld by the minimum-notice rule are
  never shown as taken - nobody booked those, and saying so would corrupt the signal the
  feature exists to send. Booked times cannot be selected on any surface, and agents
  using the MCP tools or the booking assistant continue to see only bookable times.

  `GET /v1/event-types/{slug}/slots` gains a `taken` array for opted-in event types,
  absent otherwise. Event types gain `show_taken_slots` (migration 00057).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Filter and page the bookings list.** The bookings page now filters by event type,
  host, team and status alongside the existing Upcoming/Past and Mine/All toggles, and
  pages through results 25 at a time instead of rendering everything at once. Requested
  in [#15](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/discussions/15), tracked as
  [#18](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/issues/18).

  `GET /v1/bookings` gained `event_type`, `host`, `team`, `status`, `when`, `from`,
  `to`, `order`, `limit` and `offset` query parameters, and its response now carries
  `total`, `counts` and the active `limit`/`offset` beside `items`. MCP `list_bookings`
  gained `team_id`, `limit` and `offset`, and returns `total`.

### Fixed
- **A running instance now reports which commit it is.** `/version` reported
  `commit: unknown` on every container, because the image is built from a copied
  source tree with no `.git` for the Go toolchain to read VCS metadata from. That was
  survivable while only tagged releases were deployed; it is not now that branch
  images can be, since those report `version: dev` and nothing else identified the
  build. The commit is stamped explicitly at build time instead.
- **Webhook deliveries are no longer kept forever.** Nothing ever purged
  `webhook_deliveries`, so on a busy instance the table grew for the life of the
  deployment, inside the SQLite file Litestream replicates offsite. The worker now
  sweeps finished deliveries after 30 days, alongside the five other tables it already
  purged. Only rows that reached `success` or `failed` are removed: a pending delivery
  still has a job pointing at it, and deleting one would turn a deliverable webhook
  into a permanent failure. The deliveries view only ever showed the 50 most recent, so
  nothing visible changes.
- **`status=cancelled` returned nothing, on every surface.** Both booking list queries
  hardcoded an exclusion of cancelled bookings and then filtered on top of that result,
  so asking for cancelled bookings could never match anything - including through the
  MCP tool whose own schema advertises `cancelled` as a valid value. There was no way at
  all to view a cancelled booking. An explicit status now replaces the default exclusion
  instead of being applied after it; omitting it still hides cancelled bookings.
- **Filtering by host missed the meetings that person attends but doesn't lead.** The
  host filter compared `bookings.host_id` only, while visibility has always counted a
  user as hosting a booking if they are the primary host *or* an assigned host. Group
  meetings someone was on were therefore invisible when filtering to them.

### Changed
- **Bookings are selected in SQL rather than in the browser.** `GET /v1/bookings` and
  MCP `list_bookings` previously loaded every booking the caller could see and then
  filtered and sorted the result in Go or in Svelte, running follow-up queries whose
  `IN` clause held every booking id returned, against a single-connection pool. Both now
  share one filtered, ordered, paginated query.
- **Indexed the bookings list.** The only indexes on `bookings` both led on `host_id`
  and were partial, so every listing planned as a full scan plus a temporary B-tree
  sort of the whole matching set to return one page. Paginating the API alone would
  have made the response smaller without making the work smaller. `(start_at, id)` and
  `(event_type_id, start_at, id)` (migration 00056) turn the page query into an index
  walk that stops at the limit. The Upcoming/Past counts are an aggregate and still
  scan by design.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **Slot interval is now configurable, and defaults to the meeting length.** Reported as
  "bookable timeslots are always 30 minutes apart regardless of duration" (#13). Interval
  and duration are deliberately separate settings - interval is how often a booking may
  *start*, duration is how long it *runs* - but the interval was not exposed anywhere in
  the admin UI, so every event type was stuck on the schema default of 30 unless you drove
  the REST API by hand. It now appears in the event-type editor, and new event types
  default it to their duration instead of a fixed 30, which was the wrong guess in both
  directions: a 15-minute event offered slots every 30 minutes, and a 90-minute one offered
  starts it could not honour. **Existing event types keep their stored value** until edited.
- `slot_interval_minutes` is validated on create and update. Slot generation refuses a
  non-positive interval, so a `0` previously left an event type with no bookable times and
  nothing explaining why.

### Added
- **The Connected apps page now shows the MCP connector URL, with a copy button.** It
  listed what was connected but never said how to connect anything: the only guidance was
  in the empty state, referred to "its URL" without showing one, and vanished once the
  first app was approved.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **"calendar connection not found" when choosing where bookings are written.** The
  destination endpoint looked the account up by its `calendar_connections` row id, but that
  id is recreated on every OAuth token refresh - and opening the calendar picker can trigger
  one - so a page loaded moments earlier held a dead id. Now keyed on the account identity,
  as the calendar endpoints already were.
- **Disconnecting a calendar could silently do nothing.** The same stale-id lookup, but its
  miss branch returned success, so the API answered `204` having deleted nothing and the
  account simply stayed on the page with no error. Now keyed on account identity, and a
  genuinely unknown account is reported rather than swallowed.
- **Disconnecting left the account's calendar selections behind.** `connection_calendars`
  has no foreign key on purpose (one would cascade-delete a user's selections on every token
  refresh), so disconnect flows have to clear the rows themselves - and none did, despite
  migration 00049 stating they did. Reconnecting the same address silently inherited stale
  picks, including a write target pointing at a calendar the user may no longer have.
- **The public booking page rendered blank for any event type with a dropdown
  question.** `book.html` built the dropdown's placeholder with `.T` inside the questions
  range, where the dot is the question rather than the page, so the template aborted
  partway through writing the response. The result was a **200 with correct headers and a
  truncated body**: everything up to the dropdown was present and the calendar, the slot
  picker and every script were silently missing, so the event type could not be booked at
  all. Introduced in 0.3.0 with the i18n work and not caught because no test rendered a
  select question.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- **Email can now be delivered over Resend's HTTPS API instead of SMTP.** Set a Resend
  API key under Settings → Email and mail goes out over port 443. This exists because
  **several hosting platforms block outbound SMTP on their cheaper plans** (Railway below
  Pro among them) by dropping the packets rather than refusing the connection - which
  looks like a hang, then like a wrong password, and cannot be fixed by changing any SMTP
  setting. Ports 25/465/587/2525 are all affected and it is not provider-specific.
- The transport follows the credentials you supply: an API key selects HTTPS, otherwise
  SMTP, otherwise nothing. It does **not** probe and silently switch. Settings → Email
  badges which path is actually live, so filled-in SMTP fields are never mistaken for SMTP
  delivery, and "Remove key" switches back.

### Security
- **All three image uploads now check dimensions before decoding.** The 5 MB body limit
  bounds bytes on the wire, not pixels: a highly compressed PNG of 30000x30000 is a few
  hundred KB and decodes to gigabytes. Both the logo and banner endpoints now read the
  image header first and reject anything over 25 megapixels. The branding logo and banner
  are admin-only, but **the user avatar upload is not** - any authenticated member could
  send a ~160 KB file that decoded to hundreds of megabytes, and an out-of-memory kill
  takes down the process holding the single SQLite connection. It did not need a malicious
  user either: a genuine large camera photo is well under 5 MB compressed.

### Fixed
- Checkbox answers in the admin bookings list are matched liberally. Answers are
  canonicalised to `yes`/`no` on the way in, but rows created before that landed hold
  whatever the surface sent (the embed widget sent `Yes`), and a strict comparison rendered
  those as **No** - the opposite of what the guest ticked, which matters for consent
  checkboxes. Historic rows now display correctly without rewriting stored data.
- Branding uploads read the content-type sniff buffer with `io.ReadFull`. A short read
  could hand the sniffer a truncated prefix and reject a valid image.
- **A failed SMTP dial could hang for ~2 minutes.** `defaultSMTPTimeout` was applied only
  after the connection was established, so the dial itself fell back to the OS SYN-retry
  limit. Against a host that drops SMTP packets this stalled the background job queue,
  which shares a single SQLite connection, delaying every queued email behind it; the
  email test button also appeared to hang rather than fail.
- The email test button now explains failures instead of reporting "failed to send test
  email". An unreachable server names the platform-block possibility and points at the API
  key; a timeout after connecting points at the port/TLS mode; provider rejections are
  shown verbatim.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- **Multi-language public surfaces (8 locales).** The booking page, the manage
  (reschedule/cancel) page, the embed widget, all four emails, the calendar invite
  title/description, and the conversational booking assistant are now translated into
  **English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch and Swedish**. The
  locale is negotiated from `Accept-Language` (so `de-AT` resolves to `de`), overridable
  by a footer language switcher (`?lang=`), with an operator-configurable fallback
  language in Settings → Branding for visitors whose language is not shipped.
- **The booker's locale is stored on the booking** (migration 00051), so later emails -
  reminders, cancellations, reschedule notices - arrive in the language they booked in
  rather than the language of whoever triggered the send. Host-facing sends stay English.
- **Editable assistant greeting** (migration 00052) and **fallback-language setting**
  (migration 00053).
- Adding a language requires **no code change** - dropping
  `internal/i18n/locales/<code>.json` in place is the entire task; the switcher, the
  fallback dropdown and the public API payload all read `SupportedLocales()`. See
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §23.

### Fixed
- Paid (Stripe) bookings always sent English email regardless of the language the booker
  used, because the confirmation query did not select the stored attendee locale.
- **Required checkboxes were not enforced.** A custom question of type `checkbox` marked
  required could be submitted unticked, on both the booking page and the embed widget.
  Now enforced client- and server-side, and the stored answer is canonicalised to
  `yes`/`no` instead of varying by surface.
- The public event-type endpoint returned language-dependent content without a `Vary`
  header, so a shared cache could serve one visitor's language to another.

### Notes
- **Non-English translations are LLM drafts without native review.** Structure is
  verified in CI (key parity, printf-verb parity, and a CLDR cross-check of the date
  tables against `Intl`); wording is not. Corrections via PR are welcome.
- The **built-in video room and the admin UI remain English-only.**

## [0.2.3] - 2026-08-18

### Security
- Bumped the Go toolchain from 1.26.5 to 1.26.6, closing 8 known stdlib CVEs
  (`net/http`, `encoding/xml`, `encoding/asn1`, `golang.org/x/net/idna`) that were
  reachable from Calnode's own code paths (CalDAV free/busy parsing, DB schema
  version checks, Zoom/Google HTTP clients).
- Bumped `golang.org/x/image` to v0.45.0, closing a VP8L (WebP) decode
  memory-exhaustion CVE (GO-2026-6222) reachable through the branding logo/banner
  upload endpoints, which accept WebP images.

### Added
- **Banner option on the Branding settings page.** Same upload/crop/opacity flow
  as the logo, shown full width below the logo (matching the email content
  container and the public booking form's width) on the booking page, manage
  page, and confirmation emails. Hidden entirely when not set; independent of the
  logo (either, both, or neither can be shown).
- A small link to the GitHub releases page in the admin sidebar footer, so
  self-hosted operators always have an easy way to check what version they're
  running against. The released Docker image now stamps its actual version at
  build time (`-ldflags -X buildinfo.Version=...`), which it previously didn't -
  every image, including past tagged releases, reported "dev".

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-12

### Security
- **Fixed a LiveKit host-control leak.** For a booking held on a host's connected Google or
  Microsoft calendar, the calendar event added the attendee as a guest — and the provider then
  sent its own native invite email using that event's Location, which was the host's
  *privileged* join link. An attendee opening that invite (not Calnode's own confirmation email,
  which was never affected) got instant host controls in the room. CalDAV bookings were not
  exposed (its ICS never listed the attendee as a scheduling participant, so no native invite
  was ever sent). If you've run LiveKit bookings with a Google- or Microsoft-connected host
  before this release, treat any prior host links as having been shared more widely than
  intended.

### Fixed
- The SMTP mailer had no timeout past the initial connection — a stalled or misconfigured
  server (e.g. a port/TLS-mode mismatch) could hang a send indefinitely, surfacing in the admin
  UI as "Send test email" stuck on **Sending…** forever with no error. Now bounded to 30s (or
  the caller's own deadline, if shorter).
- `Settings → Google OAuth` now warns when the page is being viewed at a different domain than
  the server's configured `BASE_URL` — the usual cause of `redirect_uri_mismatch` after moving
  to a custom domain without updating `BASE_URL` to match.

### Added
- **Storage setup instructions.** `Settings → Storage` had a status badge but no real
  instructions for configuring the recording/backups bucket; now shows a full numbered guide
  (provider suggestions, exact env vars, including `LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT`/`REGION` which weren't
  documented anywhere before). `.env.example` documents the full `LITESTREAM_*` set for the
  first time, and the previously-undocumented `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`/`TENANT` set.
- `Settings → Video` now explains when meeting recordings need the storage bucket set up, with
  a link straight to `Settings → Storage`.
- The Recordings page's "no notes yet" message now says precisely which of the notetaker's three
  requirements (recording on, a Deepgram key, an LLM configured) is missing, instead of a
  generic message that only ever mentioned the first.

[0.2.2]: https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/releases/tag/v0.2.2

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-12

Compliance and admin-UX polish.

### Added
- **AI-disclosure notice** on the booking-assistant chat panel ("Book by chat"), pinned above
  the conversation and visible before the first message, satisfying the EU AI Act's Article
  50(1) requirement that a person be told they're talking to an AI. Shown on both surfaces
  the assistant appears on: the hosted booking page and the embeddable widget.
- **Google and Microsoft now show up on the Calendar page even when unconfigured.** Previously
  an instance with no OAuth credentials for a provider simply omitted it from "Connect a
  calendar," with no indication it was ever an option. Each now renders a clearly-labelled
  "Not set up on this instance" row with a next step — a link to Settings → Google OAuth, or
  to the Microsoft setup docs.

[0.2.1]: https://github.com/Calnode/calnode/releases/tag/v0.2.1

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24

Adds per-account calendar selection and a set of admin-UX refinements from early user feedback.

### Added
- **Per-account sub-calendar selection.** Each connected account (Google, Microsoft 365, CalDAV)
  can expose several calendars; a per-connection **Manage calendars** picker chooses which are
  checked for conflicts, and free/busy honours the selection. Accounts connected before upgrading
  keep their existing behaviour (their bound calendar stays checked).
- **Out-of-office date ranges** in availability — block a multi-day span in one step.
- **Event-type archiving** with an Active / Archived filter, replacing outright deletion for
  event types you want to keep but hide.
- **Upcoming / Past filter** for bookings, keyed on the booking end time.
- Users can edit their own display name from the profile page.
- Calendar connections whose OAuth grant has been revoked or expired are now flagged
  **"Reconnect needed"** instead of surfacing a generic provider error.

### Changed
- Simplified the favicon to the plain logomark (dropping the rounded-square badge), matching
  the sign-in and invite marks.

### Fixed
- Corrected the Google OAuth redirect path in `.env.example`.
